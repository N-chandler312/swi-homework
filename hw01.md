我的第一次作业
Computer:A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.
计算机是一种通过电计算机程序可以进行数学运算和逻辑运算的设备

Computer science:Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.
计算机科学是一门研究计算机设计和使用的理论、实验的学科

Softwaware:Computer software, or simply software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work.
计算机软件是一系列包含数据和电脑指令的语句，它告诉计算机该如何工作。相反的，组成计算机系统的硬件来执行这些命令以完成工作。

Software engineering:Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.
软件工程是将工程学应用到软件发展系统化方法中的的学科。

Alan Turing:Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.[2] Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.
图灵：阿伦麦西森图灵（1912年6月23日 - 1954年6月7日）是英语计算机科学家，数学家，逻辑学家，密码分析，哲学家和理论生物学家。图灵的理论对计算机科学的发展极具影响力，他提出了被视为计算机计算模型的算法和图灵机。

Moore's law:Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. 
摩尔定律：摩尔发现在集成电路中晶体管的数量每两年增长一倍。
